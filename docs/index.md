# Workshop - Build and Deploy Spring Petclinic Application to Amazon ECS using Terraform and AWS CodePipeline 

### Introduction
This workshop is designed to enable engineers to get some hands-on experience using AWS CI/CD tools to build pipelines for ECS workloads. The workshop consists of a number of lab modules, each designed to demonstrate a CI/CD pattern. You will be using AWS services like AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CloudFormation, and AWS CodeDeploy.


### Background

The Spring PetClinic sample application is designed to show how the Spring application framework can be used to build simple, but powerful database-oriented applications. It uses AWS RDS (MySQL) at the backend and it will demonstrate the use of Spring's core functionality. The Spring Framework is a collection of small, well-focused, loosely coupled Java frameworks that can be used independently or collectively to build industrial strength applications of many different types.
